# CoNCMOR2: Coherent Nodal Cluster Model Order Reduction, version 2

Library for constructing the "Ritz" transformation matrices for the Coherent Node Cluster model-order reduction.

Based on the paper that appeared as "Rapid Free-vibration analysis with Model
Reduction based on Coherent Nodal Clusters", in the International Journal for
Numerical Methods in Engineering, 2020. Authors: Krysl, Petr, and Sivapuram,
Raghavendra; both of University of California, San Diego , Jacobs School of
Engineering Department of Structural Engineering; and Abawi, Ahmad, of Heat,
Light, and Sound Research, Inc.

Updated to work with [`Elfel`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/Elfel.jl).
If you need the model reduction package to work with [`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl), please use [`CoNCMOR`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/CoNCMOR.jl).
